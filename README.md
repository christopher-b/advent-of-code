# Advent of Code

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

Run `bin/guard` to watch for changes and run the tests.

Run `exe/advent init YEAR DAY` to initialize a new day's challenge class, test and data files.

Run `exe/advent go YEAR DAY` to run the solutions for a given day.
