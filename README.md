# Advent of Code

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

This project includes some scaffolding around the challenges, including:
- `exe/advent init YEAR DAY`: initialize a day's challenge class, test and input files. Requires the `AOC_SESSION` env var (get it from a cookie in a browser session).
- `exe/advent go YEAR DAY`: run the solutions for the day.
- `mise run test` or `bin/qt` to run all tests (includes the tests for the solutions and the scaffolding)
- `mise run watch` or `bin/guard` to run tests in watch mode
